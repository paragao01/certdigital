IBM DB2 JDBC Universal Driver for Derby

IBM DB2 JDBC Universal Driver for Apache Derby is the same JDBC driver included with the Cloudscape 10.0 product for accessing the network server. If you are using Apache Derby and would like to access the Derby Network Server, this driver allows you to connect to the Network Server via JDBC using Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA). DRDA is the Open Group's (www.opengroup.org) client/server architecture for accessing remote relational data across multiple platforms. 

Driver Jar files

These jar files are required to use the DB2 JDBC Universal driver. Put both of these jar files in your client class path to run your application. 

db2jcc.jar
db2jcc_license_c.jar


The db2jcc_for_derby.zip file includes the db2jcc.jar and db2jcc_license_c.jar files. Unzip the db2jcc.zip file into either the %DERBY_INSTALL%/lib directory (where %DERBY_INSTALL% represents the directory where you installed Derby) or another directory that is convenient. The jar files db2jcc.jar and db2jcc_license_c.jar will need to be added to your class path.
